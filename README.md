## Explanation

- Calculates abnormal return, cumulative abnormal return, average abnormal return and cumulative average abnormal reuturn of the data. Also runs a Wilcoxon signed rank test on each minute since the tweet.
- Data is taken from Binance API, unless there is missing data due to server maintenance, in which case it is taken from FTX.
- All inputs are changeable in config.json.
- Before running you have to install all packages, which you can do with:
'''python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
